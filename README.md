// Problems

// on the login page, the button says register

// after logging in, the user should be redirected to the profile page

// when I log out, the header still says my name

// when the nav is on a smaller window it collapses and bleeds contents

//all posts bleeds content when shrunk

// on media screen, in the all posts section, the titles of the posts should shrink so that the tell me more button stays skinny
